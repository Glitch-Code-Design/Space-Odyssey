                    The ESA ( European Space Agency ), is an organisation comprised of various states who's goal is to explore the vast expanse of space. Established in 1975, Paris France, made up of various founding ranging from all over Europe from Germany to Spain and many others in between.
                    In 1978 the ESA colaborated with NASA ( National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) to create the first ever high orbit telescope that was up and running until 1996, almost 20 years. During it's lifespan the telescope was used to collect data on ultraviolet rays, which could not be captured by telescopes back on the ground.

                    In 1986 the ESA had launched it's first space mission, which was to explore the Halley's comet, one of very few comets who are visible to the naked eye, and one which only appears rarely in a humans lifetime once every 75 years, give or take.

                    In 1989 the Hipparcos satellite was launched, it's mission was to map out the stars, it managed to create an archive of almost 120 thousand stars.

                    A couple of years later, SOHO was launched ( Solar Heliospheric Observatory ), it's function was to study various aspects of the sun, in the process though it managed to register well over 4 thousand comets. While SOHO was only meant to be functional for two years, the satellite has actually been in use for over 25 years, collecting various invaluable data, in fact it's even still in use to this very day, and it is planned to be kept in use until 2025.

                    Around this same time, the most commonly known telescope known to man - Hubble Space Telescope. This telescope was launched in the 90's and still remains in use to this day, it remains as one of the most instrumental tools used for space research, this great telescope was named after the renown astrologer Edwin Hubble.

                    Most of these space ventures were done in collaboration with NASA, to this day they are still collaborating in various facets of space exploration and research, with the Ariane expendable launching system which is currently slated to launch later this year.
